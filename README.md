### Brief background to my decisions

#### As it is an MVP I used:

- Flask as its good for prototyping and rapid development
- Pandas as its easy to work with and modify data and its fast
- Highchart js because I saw this as an opportunity to try it out
- Python as it it cross platform, and its what I am comfortable with

#### Other considerations with regards to all libraries used:

- They must be well documented
- Well maintained
- Stable and commonly used in production
- Decent sized online community
